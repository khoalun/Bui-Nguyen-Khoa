## Technology Highlight

### Tailwind CSS

Even though I am proficient in Pure CSS (BEM), CSS Modules, and CSS-in-JS, I opted for Tailwind CSS to speed up the creation of MVP projects.

### React-query

Handling form interactions often involves working with data. React Query is a valuable tool in this regard.

Developers frequently manage states such as loading, error handling, and form submission, along with caching and cache invalidation. React Query alleviates much of this complexity.
